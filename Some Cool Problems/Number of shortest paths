Find number of shortest paths in an undirected weighted graph from node 1 to node i for each i.
Use a modified version of Djikstra algorithm. Whenever you pop an element from the priority queue, check if
the node corresponding to that element has its shortest path already assigned and equal to the value in the popped element,
in which case increase the number of shortest paths to that node by 1.
