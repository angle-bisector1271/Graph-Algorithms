This repository is a way to organize my knowledge of graphs and graph algorithms as I go on revising the subject.
It will contain different standard and non standard algorithms, sometimes theorems with proofs, some non-trivial
results, some codes. It will potentially go on to serve as a good knowledge base for revising graphs for anyone.
